# Report 7: Final Project Progression
Having established a final project in the previous report, I will now focus on my efforts towards achieving the goals I have laid out for myself. In my previous report I did not get as far along as I was hoping, so I have some significant ground to make up here. Specifically, I need to further examine the dataset I will be using and some of the core components of the proposed network.

## Component Investigation
As discussed in my last report there are a number of key components that make up my project. In this notebook I will look into each of these components to ensure I have the understanding required to move forward. As well, this will help me locate any necessary resources for my project.

## Software Requirements
There are a number of specific software packages that are required to execute all the functionality in the notebook above. Note that not all of these will be needed, and more information can be found as one follows along in the notebook.

- tensorflow
- pytorch
- waymo_open_dataset
- open3d
- sparseconvnet

# Reflection
This week has been a lot of learning, reading, and testing. I have gained a significant amount of knowledge with sparse convolutions, graph convolutions, and more. I feel like I am ready to start implementation.
