# Report 3: Deep Learning for Robotics

As a graduate student, my current research interests are in robotics and related fields. I hope to use my Applied Math degree to pursue these interests -- in industry or as a further advanced degree. To that end, the aim of this report is to expand some of my skills in deep learning specifically related to robotics, and to get a broader understanding of how deep learning is applied to robotics.

In the first part of my report I will be following one of Intel's AI Developer Program courses, [Deep Learning for Robotics](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/training/course-deep-learning-robotics.html). This consists of four weeks of information and exercises on deep learning with robotics in mind, although I will only be completing the first week (the other three for next report). The course uses PyTorch, but I will be converting this to Tensorflow to achieve a better understanding of the tools I am working with. The materials for this can be found in the dl-4-robots-week01 folder, and specifically in the Jupyter Notebook contained within.

The second part of my report will be a summary and review of the following paper: [*Deep Learning in Robotics: A Review of Recent Research*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07217.pdf) (2017) by Harry A. Pierson and Michael S. Gashler. My aim is to better understand of deep learning in robotics, and how/where I might be able to contribute. The materials for this can be found in the Deep Learning in Robotics Jupyter Notebook.

## Dependencies:
A few dependencies are required to run the first week of the deep learning course.

- cython
- tensorflow
- pygame
- pymunk
