# Deep Learning Report 5
This report will focus on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in a variety of settings and through a variety of lenses. We will begin our investigation by surverying the chapters on RNNs in the textbook *Dive Into Deep Learning*. From here we will complete week 4 of the Deep Learning for Robotics course which focuses on RNNs, as well as a number of RNN related Tensorflow tutorials. We note that we will not be completing week 3 of the robotics course as it focuses on reinforcement learning. While interesting, this material is not as relevant to current course topics and my final project.

## Requirements
- tensorflow
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pytorch
- pandas

## Report Structure

### **A Dive Into RNNs**
This Notebook was written after reading and analyzing chapters 8 and 9 in the Goodfellow textbook. This helped me understand the inner workings of recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, it gave me a solid understanding of GRUs and LSTM which are two of the most common recurrent network architechtures. Understanding these two layers gives me a solid base for moving forward.

### **dl-4-robots-week04**
In this folder there is a Notebook describing my work on week 4 of the class. The rnn_zoo subfolder contains the code for the class with their README giving some further information, although some of it is no longer pertinent. This weeks class further solidfied my understanding of all things RNN

### **RNN Tensorflow Tutorials**
This Notebook walks through a TensorFlow tutorial on RNNs for weather time series data prediciton. Again this increased my practical abilities in working with RNNs and helped me to understand how RNNs fit in when approaching a deep learning problem.
